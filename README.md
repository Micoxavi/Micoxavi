# 👋 Hi, I'm Xavi
## I'm a mechatronics engineer currently finishing a master's degree in Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence.  
I'm a multidisciplinary engineer who thrives under pressure and enjoys learning new technologies every day.  
I believe attitude is the most important skill when it comes to solving problems — everything can be learned with the right mindset.

I'm passionate about solving real-world problems through code. I specialize in Python, computer vision and deep learning frameworks, and I enjoy building useful, well-documented systems that combine hardware, software, and automation.


### 💡 About Me

- 🎓 Engineer focused on automating analysis, testing, and documentation in electronics & optical labs  
- 💼 Currently developing computer-vision solutions for lighting validation and imaging in an optical laboratory  
- ⚙️ Experienced in CV-driven quality control and inspection, from lab benches to automotive applications  
- 🔍 Hands-on experience with multi-sensor time-alignment (LiDAR, cameras) and real-time data processing  
- 🧪 Maker at heart — I love prototyping, optimizing code, and hacking on side projects
- 🍳 Fun fact: I’m a passionate home-chef who loves experimenting with flavours and techniques from different cultures
